<h1>ABOUT US</h1> 
<p style="color: brown; font-size: 25px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify;">
I am writing on behalf of our tech community to seek your support for our upcoming program, the Zaria Tech Summit, scheduled to take place from March 28th to April 1st, 2024.
Our community is comprised of tech enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, professionals, and learners who share a common interest in leveraging technology to address socio-economic challenges, particularly among young people. As part of our mission, we are organizing a workshop aimed at training youths in the community who aspire to pursue careers in various aspects of technology.
We believe that this program aligns with the broader vision of NITDA, to project Nigeria as a Tech Nation and empower the youths with necessary skills to technical talents that can fill the gap in the world technological ecosystem. 
The program is designed to be cost-free for participants, ensuring that financial considerations do not pose a barrier to attendance. We are reaching out to you with the hope that you could support our initiative, either as a facilitator for specific sessions or by providing resources such as financial support, materials, or any opportunities within your capacity that would greatly benefit the participants.
Your involvement in this endeavor would undoubtedly contribute to the success of our program and help shape the future of aspiring tech professionals.
We look forward to the possibility of working together on this initiative. Please feel free to contact us if you require any additional information or clarification. Thank you for your time, consideration, and potential support.
